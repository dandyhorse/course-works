2. Counting

SELECT fl.uniquecarrier, count(*) AS load FROM flights fl
GROUP BY fl.uniquecarrier
SORT BY load DESC;

3. Total number of flights 

SELECT count(*) FROM flights AS fl
    JOIN airports ap1
       ON (fl.origin = ap1.iata)
    JOIN airports ap2
       ON (fl.dest = ap2.iata)
WHERE (ap1.city = "New York" OR ap2.city = "New York")
AND fl.month = 6;

4. Five most busy airports

SELECT us_aps.iadata, count(*) AS load FROM (
  SELECT fl.origin AS iadata FROM flights fl
      JOIN airports AS ap ON (fl.dest = ap.iata)
       WHERE (fl.month <= 8 AND fl.dayofmonth <= 31)
       AND (fl.month >=6 AND fl.dayofmonth >=1)
       AND ap.country='USA'
  union all
  SELECT fl.dest AS iadata FROM flights fl
  JOIN airports AS ap ON (fl.origin = ap.iata)
       WHERE (fl.month <= 8 AND fl.dayofmonth <= 31)
       AND (fl.month >=6 AND fl.dayofmonth >=1)
       AND ap.country='USA'
) AS us_aps
GROUP BY us_aps.iadata
SORT BY load desc
LIMIT 5;

5. Find the carrier

SELECT fl.uniquecarrier, count(*) AS load FROM flights AS fl
GROUP BY fl.uniquecarrier
SORT BY load DESC
LIMIT 1;
