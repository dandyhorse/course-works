<p>She should have died hereafter;</p>
<p>There would have been a time for such a word.</p>
<p>â€” To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,</p>
<p>Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,</p>
<p>To the last syllable of recorded time;</p>
<p>And all our yesterdays have lighted fools</p>
<p>The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!</p>
<p>Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player</p>
<p>That struts and frets his hour upon the stage</p>
<p>And then is heard no more. It is a tale</p>
<p>Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury</p>
<p>Signifying nothing.</p>
